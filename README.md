## Description
This project should allow anyone interested to create a fully functional computer from scratch, using code.   
The project emulates a real computer by relying on virtual-components (i.e logic gates, CPU components etc.) written using code,
which should allow for any computer configuration you may want.

## How does it work?
Simply put, this project is like an union, which is basically how a real computer is as well.   
That means that it has many layers of abstractions - from the very basic boolean - true, false / on, off / 0, 1 to logic gates, to components such as enablers, decoders, RAM, Registers etc. to a fully-fledged Control Unit, ALU etc. and from there to a fully functional CPU which can then be integrated with other componenets to create a fully-functional computer.   
The project supplies the minimum for creating any of these components, it supplies the minimum common denominator of any computer - no more, no less.   
For starters, I will create a fully functional 8 bit computer using infrastructure that I will make, and from there on, it is unknown what and how will become of this project.
